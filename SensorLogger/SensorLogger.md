# Real-Time Tracking Simulation Using SensorLogger
# Real-Time Tracking Simulation

## Overview
This simulation leverages HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Mapbox GL JS to dynamically display the movements of individuals based on GPS data collected from SensorLogger on iPhone and Apple Watch devices. It demonstrates the potential of real-time GPS tracking for various applications.

## Purpose and Functionality

### Dynamic Tracking
- **Primary Goal**: Provide real-time tracking of individuals by simulating movement along predefined routes on a map.
- **Live Data Integration**: Suitable for reflecting real-time movement, potentially derived from live data streams.

### Multi-Device Compatibility
- **Device Support**: Utilizes data from SensorLogger apps on both iPhone and Apple Watch.
- **Broad Applicability**: Ensures the simulation is applicable to users with different devices.

### User Interaction and Engagement
- **Interactive Visualization**: Designed to engage users by providing interactive and dynamic visual tracking.
- **Versatile Use Cases**: Ideal for monitoring athletic training, coordinating events, or educational demonstrations.

### Development and Testing of Tracking Algorithms
- **Algorithm Enhancement**: Allows developers to test and improve algorithms for pace calculation, movement prediction, and route optimization.
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Facilitates algorithm testing under dynamic conditions.

### Scalability and Customization
- **Flexible Application**: Can be scaled and customized for various needs from small group activities to large-scale public events.
- **Custom Features**: Supports adjustments for different participant numbers, geographic locations, and specific tracking requirements.

This framework serves as a robust tool for diverse applications including urban planning, wildlife tracking, and any scenario requiring precise geographical movement tracking.
